Hey there! I'm happily trying to reach a very first stage for this 
brand new package. Hope to deliver a very basic set of functions soon.

## New features

Add `sort_sources()` and `group_events()` functions as the very foundation of the
package. The fundamental vignette is basic workflow.
Hope the website will print nicely, as well as many other features (licence, cmd
check...)
